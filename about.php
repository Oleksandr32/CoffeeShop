					By day, Fourth Coffee is a cosy coffee shop where friends meet to share coffee, cakes and light meals. At night, it is transformed into a 	vibey eatery. It is the meeting place in Grahamstown for family, friends, business associates and couples – in short, a place for everyone from early morning breakfast to drinks late at night. With free Wi-Fi, Fourth is also a favourite temporary study or work venue. Revelations is truly the place “Where it all comes together. “If you’re looking for the perfect spot to host your next birthday party or event, the shaded courtyard is available for hire (catering options are also available). Revelations Coffee Shop is conveniently positioned in the secure Peppergrove Mall, where parking is free. The cafe opened it s doors on January 20, 2007. Since day one the café has been a staple to the community. The owners believe very much in “keeping it simple” and “making it special.” We offer delicious breakfast and lunch options as well as a full coffee bar. We feature local art on our walls and have FREE WiFi. We offer vegetarian and vegan options. We proudly serve La Colombe coffee and Metropolitan bread. We also offer a pastry case full of homemade treats that we bake daily on site.
