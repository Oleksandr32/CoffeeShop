						<p class="product_desc">Coffee beans grown in Guatemala typically have tasting notes indicating a full body and a rich chocolatey-cocoa flavor, and a toffee-like sweetness. Guatemalan coffees are true central American coffees. In particular the Strictly Hard Bean green coffees grown in the Atitlan and Antigua coffee growing regions in the country’s central highlands exhibit these qualities as well as a floral acidity that is often spicy or chocolaty. Some coffee reviews note that a lighter acidity is found among the coffees grown in mountain areas exposed to the Caribbean or exposed to the Pacific Ocean and these coffees tend to exhibit more of a fruity acidity and flavor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="close_g keep_reading">Close</a></p>

						<p class="product_desc">African Coffees tend to have sweet, fruity flavors which are balanced by a somewhat tart acidity. By blending the various African coffees together, these characteristics are emphasized. The African Blend is a medium to full-bodied blend of coffee beans grown exclusively in East Africa. Although coffee is grown in other parts of Africa, the best Arabica beans come from the high mountainous regions in the tropical belt of East Africa. The beans and brew emit a fragrant, fruity bouquet. Our passion for coffee began in Rwanda in East Africa, so it seems right to offer you a blend of coffees from this special coffee-producing region. We have chosen a mix of coffees that, together, gives you a memorable and enjoyable cup of coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="close_a keep_reading">Close</a></p>
